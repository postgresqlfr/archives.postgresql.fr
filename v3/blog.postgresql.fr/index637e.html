<p>Tom Lane pushed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mop-up for setting minimum Tcl version to 8.4.</li>
</ul>
<p>Commit e2609323e set the minimum Tcl version we support to 8.4, but I forgot to adjust the documentation to say the same. Some nosing around for other consequences found that the configure script could be simplified slightly as well.</p>
<p>Branch ------ master</p>
<p>Details ------- <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/9da70efcbe09954b1006f878d39885a4acf1c534">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/9da70efcbe09954b1006f878d39885a4acf1c534</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Fix unportable usage of &lt;ctype.h&gt; functions. isdigit(), isspace(), etc are likely to give surprising results if passed a signed char. We should always cast the argument to unsigned char to avoid that. Error in commit d78a7d9c7fa3e9cd, found by buildfarm member gaur. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/cb0ca0c9953aa0614e7b143bd2440a7582a27233">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/cb0ca0c9953aa0614e7b143bd2440a7582a27233</a></li>
<li>Fix not-terribly-safe coding in NIImportOOAffixes() and NIImportAffixes(). There were two places in spell.c that supposed that they could search for a location in a string produced by lowerstr() and then transpose the offset into the original string. But this fails completely if lowerstr() transforms any characters into characters of different byte length, as can happen in Turkish UTF8 for instance. We'd added some comments about this coding in commit 51e78ab4ff328296, but failed to realize that it was not merely confusing but wrong. Coverity complained about this code years ago, but in such an opaque fashion that nobody understood what it was on about. I'm not entirely sure that this issue *is* what it's on about, actually, but perhaps this patch will shut it up -- and in any case the problem is clear. Back-patch to all supported branches. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/b3e05097e58051a7816ed734074fd76345687e0c">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/b3e05097e58051a7816ed734074fd76345687e0c</a></li>
<li>Fix broken definition for function name in pgbench's exprscan.l. As written, this would accept e.g. 123e9 as a function name. Aside from being mildly astonishing, that would come back to haunt us if we ever try to add float constants to the expression syntax. Insist that function names start with letters (or at least non-digits). In passing reset yyline as well as yycol when starting a new expression. This variable is useless since it's used nowhere, but if we're going to have it we should have it act sanely. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/3899caf772c8dec5c79e553c91f8fc248ca686c9">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/3899caf772c8dec5c79e553c91f8fc248ca686c9</a></li>
<li>Re-fix broken definition for function name in pgbench's exprscan.l. Wups, my first try wasn't quite right either. Too focused on fixing the existing bug, not enough on not introducing new ones. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/94f1adccd36df3ad75d2c257c9ae1ca448f3e4ac">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/94f1adccd36df3ad75d2c257c9ae1ca448f3e4ac</a></li>
<li>Fix backwards test for Windows service-ness in pg_ctl. A thinko in a96761391 caused pg_ctl to get it exactly backwards when deciding whether to report problems to the Windows eventlog or to stderr. Per bug #14001 from Manuel Mathar, who also identified the fix. Like the previous patch, back-patch to all supported branches. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/b642e50aea1b966f3b78c49e806b4a2c5497a861">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/b642e50aea1b966f3b78c49e806b4a2c5497a861</a></li>
<li>Make the upper part of the planner work by generating and comparing Paths. I've been saying we needed to do this for more than five years, and here it finally is. This patch removes the ever-growing tangle of spaghetti logic that grouping_planner() used to use to try to identify the best plan for post-scan/join query steps. Now, there is (nearly) independent consideration of each execution step, and entirely separate construction of Paths to represent each of the possible ways to do that step. We choose the best Path or set of Paths using the same add_path() logic that's been used inside query_planner() for years. In addition, this patch removes the old restriction that subquery_planner() could return only a single Plan. It now returns a RelOptInfo containing a set of Paths, just as query_planner() does, and the parent query level can use each of those Paths as the basis of a SubqueryScanPath at its level. This allows finding some optimizations that we missed before, wherein a subquery was capable of returning presorted data and thereby avoiding a sort in the parent level, making the overall cost cheaper even though delivering sorted output was not the cheapest plan for the subquery in isolation. (A couple of regression test outputs change in consequence of that. However, there is very little change in visible planner behavior overall, because the point of this patch is not to get immediate planning benefits but to create the infrastructure for future improvements.) There is a great deal left to do here. This patch unblocks a lot of planner work that was basically impractical in the old code structure, such as allowing FDWs to implement remote aggregation, or rewriting plan_set_operations() to allow consideration of multiple implementation orders for set operations. (The latter will likely require a full rewrite of plan_set_operations(); what I've done here is only to fix it to return Paths not Plans.) I have also left unfinished some localized refactoring in createplan.c and planner.c, because it was not necessary to get this patch to a working state. Thanks to Robert Haas, David Rowley, and Amit Kapila for review. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/3fc6e2d7f5b652b417fa6937c34de2438d60fa9f">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/3fc6e2d7f5b652b417fa6937c34de2438d60fa9f</a></li>
<li>Spell "parallel" correctly. Per David Rowley. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/cf8e7b16a5f3e63fe692d042fefc0c9f09a23ebc">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/cf8e7b16a5f3e63fe692d042fefc0c9f09a23ebc</a></li>
<li>Fix minor typo in logical-decoding docs. David Rowley <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a93aec4e0f061ad43034d5324b8407a824e54395">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a93aec4e0f061ad43034d5324b8407a824e54395</a></li>
<li>Finish refactoring make_foo() functions in createplan.c. This patch removes some redundant cost calculations that I left for later cleanup in commit 3fc6e2d7f5b652b4. There's now a uniform policy that the make_foo() convenience functions don't do any cost calculations. Most of their callers copy costs from the source Path node, and for those that don't, the calculation in the make_foo() function wasn't necessarily right anyhow. (make_result() was particularly a mess, as it was serving multiple callers using cost calcs designed for only the first one or two that had ever existed.) Aside from saving a few cycles, this ensures that what EXPLAIN prints matches the costs we used for planning purposes. It does not change any planner decisions, since the decisions are already made. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/8c314b9853c2fbb85c041d4761426f25a9d63972">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/8c314b9853c2fbb85c041d4761426f25a9d63972</a></li>
<li>Fix minor thinko in pathification code. I passed the wrong "root" struct to create_pathtarget in build_minmax_path. Since the subroot is a clone of the outer root, this would not cause any serious problems, but it would waste some cycles because set_pathtarget_cost_width would not have access to Var width estimates set up while running query_planner on the subroot. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/61fd218930db53079e5f001dd4ea2fd53afd1b95">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/61fd218930db53079e5f001dd4ea2fd53afd1b95</a></li>
<li>Improve handling of group-column indexes in GroupingSetsPath. Instead of having planner.c compute a groupColIdx array and store it in GroupingSetsPaths, make create_groupingsets_plan() find the grouping columns by searching in the child plan node's tlist. Although that's probably a bit slower for create_groupingsets_plan(), it's more like the way every other plan node type does this, and it provides positive confirmation that we know which child output columns we're supposed to be grouping on. (Indeed, looking at this now, I'm not at all sure that it wasn't broken before, because create_groupingsets_plan() isn't demanding an exact tlist match from its child node.) Also, this allows substantial simplification in planner.c, because it no longer needs to compute the groupColIdx array at all; no other cases were using it. I'd intended to put off this refactoring until later (like 9.7), but in view of the likely bug fix and the need to rationalize planner.c's tlist handling so we can do something sane with Konstantin Knizhnik's function-evaluation-postponement patch, I think it can't wait. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/9e8b99420fe5f80495ada8dc50aeb7b954b33093">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/9e8b99420fe5f80495ada8dc50aeb7b954b33093</a></li>
<li>Improve handling of pathtargets in planner.c. Refactor so that the internal APIs in planner.c deal in PathTargets not targetlists, and establish a more regular structure for deriving the targets needed for successive steps. There is more that could be done here; calculating the eval costs of each successive target independently is both inefficient and wrong in detail, since we won't actually recompute values available from the input node's tlist. But it's no worse than what happened before the pathification rewrite. In any case this seems like a good starting point for considering how to handle Konstantin Knizhnik's function-evaluation-postponement patch. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/51c0f63e4d76a86b44e87876a6addcfffb01ec28">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/51c0f63e4d76a86b44e87876a6addcfffb01ec28</a></li>

<li>Fix incorrect tlist generation in create_gather_plan(). This function is written as though Gather doesn't project; but it does. Even if it did not project, though, we must use build_path_tlist to ensure that the output columns receive correct sortgroupref labeling. Per report from Amit Kapila. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/8776c15c85322612b9bf79daf50f74be71c12e05">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/8776c15c85322612b9bf79daf50f74be71c12e05</a></li>
<li>Fix incorrect handling of NULL index entries in indexed ROW() comparisons. An index search using a row comparison such as ROW(a, b) &gt; ROW('x', 'y') would stop upon reaching a NULL entry in the "b" column, ignoring the fact that there might be non-NULL "b" values associated with later values of "a". This happens because _bt_mark_scankey_required() marks the subsidiary scankey for "b" as required, which is just wrong: it's for a column after the one with the first inequality key (namely "a"), and thus can't be considered a required match. This bit of brain fade dates back to the very beginnings of our support for indexed ROW() comparisons, in 2006. Kind of astonishing that no one came across it before Glen Takahashi, in bug #14010. Back-patch to all supported versions. Note: the given test case doesn't actually fail in unpatched 9.1, evidently because the fix for bug #6278 (i.e., stopping at nulls in either scan direction) is required to make it fail. I'm sure I could devise a case that fails in 9.1 as well, perhaps with something involving making a cursor back up; but it doesn't seem worth the trouble. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a298a1e06fb0574c898a07761f9f86c2a323919e">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a298a1e06fb0574c898a07761f9f86c2a323919e</a></li>
<li>Remove a couple of useless pstrdup() calls. There's no point in pstrdup'ing the result of TextDatumGetCString, since that's necessarily already a freshly-palloc'd C string. These particular calls are unlikely to be of any consequence performance-wise, but still they're a bad precedent that can confuse future patch authors.

<li>Refactor pull_var_clause's API to make it less tedious to extend. In commit 1d97c19a0f748e94 and later c1d9579dd8bf3c92, we extended pull_var_clause's API by adding enum-type arguments. That's sort of a pain to maintain, though, because it means every time we add a new behavior we must touch every last one of the call sites, even if there's a reasonable default behavior that most of them could use. Let's switch over to using a bitmask of flags, instead; that seems more maintainable and might save a nanosecond or two as well. This commit changes no behavior in itself, though I'm going to follow it up with one that does add a new behavior. In passing, remove flatten_tlist(), which has not been used since 9.1 and would otherwise need the same API changes. Removing these enums means that optimizer/tlist.h no longer needs to depend on optimizer/var.h. Changing that caused a number of C files to need addition of #include "optimizer/var.h" (probably we can thank old runs of pgrminclude for that); but on balance it seems like a good change anyway. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/364a9f47ab363250f62dd2c381c4da435283725a">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/364a9f47ab363250f62dd2c381c4da435283725a</a></li>
<li>Give pull_var_clause() reject/recurse/return behavior for WindowFuncs too. All along, this function should have treated WindowFuncs in a manner similar to Aggrefs, ie with an option whether or not to recurse into them. By not considering the case, it was always recursing, which is OK for most callers (although I suspect that the case in prepare_sort_from_pathkeys might represent a bug). But now we need return-without-recursing behavior as well. There are also more than a few callers that should never see a WindowFunc, and now we'll get some error checking on that. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/c82c92b111b7b636e80f8a432de10c62011b35b6">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/c82c92b111b7b636e80f8a432de10c62011b35b6</a></li>
<li>Minor additional refactoring of planner.c's PathTarget handling. Teach make_group_input_target() and make_window_input_target() to work entirely with the PathTarget representation of tlists, rather than constructing a tlist and immediately deconstructing it into PathTarget format. In itself this only saves a few palloc's; the bigger picture is that it opens the door for sharing cost_qual_eval work across all of planner.c's constructions of PathTargets. I'll come back to that later. In support of this, flesh out tlist.c's infrastructure for PathTargets a bit more. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/49635d7b3e86c0088eadd80db1563a210bc89efd">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/49635d7b3e86c0088eadd80db1563a210bc89efd</a></li>
<li>When appropriate, postpone SELECT output expressions till after ORDER BY. It is frequently useful for volatile, set-returning, or expensive functions in a SELECT's targetlist to be postponed till after ORDER BY and LIMIT are done. Otherwise, the functions might be executed for every row of the table despite the presence of LIMIT, and/or be executed in an unexpected order. For example, in SELECT x, nextval('seq') FROM tab ORDER BY x LIMIT 10; it's probably desirable that the nextval() values are ordered the same as x, and that nextval() is not run more than 10 times. In the past, Postgres was inconsistent in this area: you would get the desirable behavior if the ordering were performed via an indexscan, but not if it had to be done by an explicit sort step. Getting the desired behavior reliably required contortions like SELECT x, nextval('seq') FROM (SELECT x FROM tab ORDER BY x) ss LIMIT 10; This patch conditionally postpones evaluation of pure-output target expressions (that is, those that are not used as DISTINCT, ORDER BY, or GROUP BY columns) so that they effectively occur after sorting, even if an explicit sort step is necessary. Volatile expressions and set-returning expressions are always postponed, so as to provide consistent semantics. Expensive expressions (costing more than 10 times typical operator cost, which by default would include any user-defined function) are postponed if there is a LIMIT or if there are expressions that must be postponed. We could be more aggressive and postpone any nontrivial expression, but there are costs associated with doing so: it requires an extra Result plan node which adds some overhead, and postponement changes the volume of data going through the sort step, perhaps for the worse. Since we tend not to have very good estimates of the output width of nontrivial expressions, it's hard to have much confidence in our ability to predict whether postponement would increase or decrease the cost of the sort; therefore this patch doesn't attempt to make decisions conditionally on that. Between these factors and a general desire not to change query behavior when there's not a demonstrable benefit, it seems best to be conservative about applying postponement. We might tweak the decision rules in the future, though.

<li>Get rid of scribbling on a const variable in psql's print.c. Commit a2dabf0e1dda93c8 had the bright idea that it could modify a "const" global variable if it merely casted away const from a pointer. This does not work on platforms where the compiler puts "const" variables into read-only storage. Depressingly, we evidently have no such platforms in our buildfarm ... an oversight I have now remedied. (The one platform that is known to catch this is recent OS X with -fno-common.) Per report from Chris Ruprecht. Back-patch to 9.5 where the bogus code was introduced. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/fc7a9dfddb073a55a226778acd6a9b3f5ea2e626">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/fc7a9dfddb073a55a226778acd6a9b3f5ea2e626</a></li>
<li>Widen query numbers-of-tuples-processed counters to uint64. This patch widens SPI_processed, EState's es_processed field, PortalData's portalPos field, FuncCallContext's call_cntr and max_calls fields, ExecutorRun's count argument, PortalRunFetch's result, and the max number of rows in a SPITupleTable to uint64, and deals with (I hope) all the ensuing fallout. Some of these values were declared uint32 before, and others "long". I also removed PortalData's posOverflow field, since that logic seems pretty useless given that portalPos is now always 64 bits. The user-visible results are that command tags for SELECT etc will correctly report tuple counts larger than 4G, as will plpgsql's GET GET DIAGNOSTICS ... ROW_COUNT command. Queries processing more tuples than that are still not exactly the norm, but they're becoming more common. Most values associated with FETCH/MOVE distances, such as PortalRun's count argument and the count argument of most SPI functions that have one, remain declared as "long". It's not clear whether it would be worth promoting those to int64; but it would definitely be a large dollop of additional API churn on top of this, and it would only help 32-bit platforms which seem relatively less likely to see any benefit.

<li>Fix memory leak in repeated GIN index searches. Commit d88976cfa1302e8d removed this code from ginFreeScanKeys(): if (entry-&gt;list) pfree(entry-&gt;list); evidently in the belief that that ItemPointer array is allocated in the keyCtx and so would be reclaimed by the following MemoryContextReset. Unfortunately, it isn't and it won't. It'd likely be a good idea for that to become so, but as a simple and back-patchable fix in the meantime, restore this code to ginFreeScanKeys(). Also, add a similar pfree to where startScanEntry() is about to zero out entry-&gt;list. I am not sure if there are any code paths where this change prevents a leak today, but it seems like cheap future-proofing. In passing, make the initial allocation of so-&gt;entries[] use palloc not palloc0. The code doesn't depend on unused entries being zero; if it did, the array-enlargement code in ginFillScanEntry() would be wrong. So using palloc0 initially can only serve to confuse readers about what the invariant is.

<li>Introduce durable_rename() and durable_link_or_rename(). Renaming a file using rename(2) is not guaranteed to be durable in face of crashes; especially on filesystems like xfs and ext4 when mounted with data=writeback. To be certain that a rename() atomically replaces the previous file contents in the face of crashes and different filesystems, one has to fsync the old filename, rename the file, fsync the new filename, fsync the containing directory. This sequence is not generally adhered to currently; which exposes us to data loss risks. To avoid having to repeat this arduous sequence, introduce durable_rename(), which wraps all that. Also add durable_link_or_rename(). Several places use link() (with a fallback to rename()) to rename a file, trying to avoid replacing the target file out of paranoia. Some of those rename sequences need to be durable as well. There seems little reason extend several copies of the same logic, so centralize the link() callers. This commit does not yet make use of the new functions; they're used in a followup commit.

<li>Avoid unlikely data-loss scenarios due to rename() without fsync. Renaming a file using rename(2) is not guaranteed to be durable in face of crashes. Use the previously added durable_rename()/durable_link_or_rename() in various places where we previously just renamed files. Most of the changed call sites are arguably not critical, but it seems better to err on the side of too much durability. The most prominent known case where the previously missing fsyncs could cause data loss is crashes at the end of a checkpoint. After the actual checkpoint has been performed, old WAL files are recycled. When they're filled, their contents are fdatasynced, but we did not fsync the containing directory. An OS/hardware crash in an unfortunate moment could then end up leaving that file with its old name, but new content; WAL replay would thus not replay it.

<li>Checkpoint sorting and balancing. Up to now checkpoints were written in the order they're in the BufferDescriptors. That's nearly random in a lot of cases, which performs badly on rotating media, but even on SSDs it causes slowdowns. To avoid that, sort checkpoints before writing them out. We currently sort by tablespace, relfilenode, fork and block number. One of the major reasons that previously wasn't done, was fear of imbalance between tablespaces. To address that balance writes between tablespaces. The other prime concern was that the relatively large allocation to sort the buffers in might fail, preventing checkpoints from happening. Thus pre-allocate the required memory in shared memory, at server startup. This particularly makes it more efficient to have checkpoint flushing enabled, because that'll often result in a lot of writes that can be coalesced into one flush. Discussion: alpine.DEB.2.10.1506011320000.28433@sto Author: Fabien Coelho and Andres Freund <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/9cd00c457e6a1ebb984167ac556a9961812a683c">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/9cd00c457e6a1ebb984167ac556a9961812a683c</a></li>
<li>Allow to trigger kernel writeback after a configurable number of writes. Currently writes to the main data files of postgres all go through the OS page cache. This means that some operating systems can end up collecting a large number of dirty buffers in their respective page caches. When these dirty buffers are flushed to storage rapidly, be it because of fsync(), timeouts, or dirty ratios, latency for other reads and writes can increase massively. This is the primary reason for regular massive stalls observed in real world scenarios and artificial benchmarks; on rotating disks stalls on the order of hundreds of seconds have been observed. On linux it is possible to control this by reducing the global dirty limits significantly, reducing the above problem. But global configuration is rather problematic because it'll affect other applications; also PostgreSQL itself doesn't always generally want this behavior, e.g. for temporary files it's undesirable. Several operating systems allow some control over the kernel page cache. Linux has sync_file_range(2), several posix systems have msync(2) and posix_fadvise(2). sync_file_range(2) is preferable because it requires no special setup, whereas msync() requires the to-be-flushed range to be mmap'ed. For the purpose of flushing dirty data posix_fadvise(2) is the worst alternative, as flushing dirty data is just a side-effect of POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED, which also removes the pages from the page cache. Thus the feature is enabled by default only on linux, but can be enabled on all systems that have any of the above APIs. While desirable and likely possible this patch does not contain an implementation for windows. With the infrastructure added, writes made via checkpointer, bgwriter and normal user backends can be flushed after a configurable number of writes. Each of these sources of writes controlled by a separate GUC, checkpointer_flush_after, bgwriter_flush_after and backend_flush_after respectively; they're separate because the number of flushes that are good are separate, and because the performance considerations of controlled flushing for each of these are different. A later patch will add checkpoint sorting - after that flushes from the ckeckpoint will almost always be desirable. Bgwriter flushes are most of the time going to be random, which are slow on lots of storage hardware. Flushing in backends works well if the storage and bgwriter can keep up, but if not it can have negative consequences. This patch is likely to have negative performance consequences without checkpoint sorting, but unfortunately so has sorting without flush control.

<li>psql: Fix some strange code in SQL help creation. Struct QL_HELP used to be defined as static in the sql_help.h header file, which is included in sql_help.c and help.c, thus creating two separate instances of the struct. This causes a warning from GCC 6, because the struct is not used in sql_help.c. Instead, declare the struct as extern in the header file and define it in sql_help.c. This also allows making a bunch of functions static because they are no longer needed outside of sql_help.c.

<li>pg_upgrade: Remove converter plugin facility.

<li>Add a generic command progress reporting facility. Using this facility, any utility command can report the target relation upon which it is operating, if there is one, and up to 10 64-bit counters; the intent of this is that users should be able to figure out what a utility command is doing without having to resort to ugly hacks like attaching strace to a backend. As a demonstration, this adds very crude reporting to lazy vacuum; we just report the target relation and nothing else. A forthcoming patch will make VACUUM report a bunch of additional data that will make this much more interesting. But this gets the basic framework in place.

<li>Don't vacuum all-frozen pages. Commit a892234f830e832110f63fc0a2afce2fb21d1584 gave us enough infrastructure to avoid vacuuming pages where every tuple on the page is already frozen. So, replace the notion of a scan_all or whole-table vacuum with the less onerous notion of an "aggressive" vacuum, which will pages that are all-visible, but still skip those that are all-frozen. This should greatly reduce the cost of anti-wraparound vacuuming on large clusters where the majority of data is never touched between one cycle and the next, because we'll no longer have to read all of those pages only to find out that we don't need to do anything with them.

Adds several tsvector editting function: convert tsvector to/from text array, set weight for given lexemes, delete lexeme(s), unnest, filter lexemes with given weights Author: Stas Kelvich with some editorization by me Reviewers: Tomas Vondram, Teodor Sigaev <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/6943a946c7e5eb72d53c0ce71f08a81a133503bd">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/6943a946c7e5eb72d53c0ce71f08a81a133503bd</a></li>
<li>Bump catalog version missed in 6943a946c7e5eb72d53c0ce71f08a81a133503bd <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a9eb6c83efd258bb7a658fefa0074e0e65efd673">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a9eb6c83efd258bb7a658fefa0074e0e65efd673</a></li>
<li>Fix merge affixes for numeric ones. Some dictionaries have duplicated base words with different affix set, we just merge that sets into one set. But previously merging of sets of affixes was actually a concatenation of strings but it's wrong for numeric representation of affixes because such representation uses comma to separate affixes.
