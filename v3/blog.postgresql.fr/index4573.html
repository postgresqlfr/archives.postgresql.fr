<li>Fix docs typo. Spotted by Thomas Munro <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/b9ff79b8f17697f3df492017d454caa9920a7183">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/b9ff79b8f17697f3df492017d454caa9920a7183</a></li>

<ul>
<li>Transaction control in PL procedures In each of the supplied procedural languages (PL/pgSQL, PL/Perl, PL/Python, PL/Tcl), add language-specific commit and rollback functions/commands to control transactions in procedures in that language. Add similar underlying functions to SPI. Some additional cleanup so that transaction commit or abort doesn't blow away data structures still used by the procedure call. Add execution context tracking to CALL and DO statements so that transaction control commands can only be issued in top-level procedure and block calls, not function calls or other procedure or block calls. - SPI Add a new function SPI_connect_ext() that is like SPI_connect() but allows passing option flags. The only option flag right now is SPI_OPT_NONATOMIC. A nonatomic SPI connection can execute transaction control commands, otherwise it's not allowed. This is meant to be passed down from CALL and DO statements which themselves know in which context they are called. A nonatomic SPI connection uses different memory management. A normal SPI connection allocates its memory in TopTransactionContext. For nonatomic connections we use PortalContext instead. As the comment in SPI_connect_ext() (previously SPI_connect()) indicates, one could potentially use PortalContext in all cases, but it seems safest to leave the existing uses alone, because this stuff is complicated enough already. SPI also gets new functions SPI_start_transaction(), SPI_commit(), and SPI_rollback(), which can be used by PLs to implement their transaction control logic. - portalmem.c Some adjustments were made in the code that cleans up portals at transaction abort. The portal code could already handle a command *committing* a transaction and continuing (e.g., VACUUM), but it was not quite prepared for a command *aborting* a transaction and continuing. In AtAbort_Portals(), remove the code that marks an active portal as failed. As the comment there already predicted, this doesn't work if the running command wants to keep running after transaction abort. And it's actually not necessary, because pquery.c is careful to run all portal code in a PG_TRY block and explicitly runs MarkPortalFailed() if there is an exception. So the code in AtAbort_Portals() is never used anyway. In AtAbort_Portals() and AtCleanup_Portals(), we need to be careful not to clean up active portals too much. This mirrors similar code in PreCommit_Portals(). - PL/Perl Gets new functions spi_commit() and spi_rollback() - PL/pgSQL Gets new commands COMMIT and ROLLBACK. Update the PL/SQL porting example in the documentation to reflect that transactions are now possible in procedures. - PL/Python Gets new functions plpy.commit and plpy.rollback. - PL/Tcl Gets new commands commit and rollback.

<li>PL/Python: Fix tests for older Python versions. Commit 8561e4840c81f7e345be2df170839846814fa004 neglected to handle older Python versions that don't support the "with" statement. So write the tests in a way that older versions can handle as well. <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/f498704346a4ce4953fc5f837cacb545b3166ee1">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/f498704346a4ce4953fc5f837cacb545b3166ee1</a></li>
<li>Split out documentation of SSL parameters into their own section. Split the "Authentication and Security" section into two separate sections "Authentication" and "SSL". The latter part has gotten much longer over time, and doesn't primarily have to do with authentication. Also, the row_security parameter was inconsistently categorized, so clean that up while we're here. <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/7404e77cc1192855afef28ae557993ba6f35c16e">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/7404e77cc1192855afef28ae557993ba6f35c16e</a></li>
<li>Move EDH support to common files. The EDH support is not really specific to the OpenSSL implementation, so move the support and documentation comments to common files. <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/573bd08b99e277026e87bb55ae69c489fab321b8">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/573bd08b99e277026e87bb55ae69c489fab321b8</a></li>
<li>Add installcheck support to more test suites. Several of the test suites under src/test/ were missing an installcheck target. <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/f5da5683a86e9fc42fdf3eae2da8b096bda76a8a">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/f5da5683a86e9fc42fdf3eae2da8b096bda76a8a</a></li>
<li>Extract common bits from OpenSSL implementation. Some things in be-secure-openssl.c and fe-secure-openssl.c were not actually specific to OpenSSL but could also be used by other implementations. In order to avoid copy-and-pasting, move some of that code to common files. <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/1c2183403b958422c27782329ba19f9a3e0874ba">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/1c2183403b958422c27782329ba19f9a3e0874ba</a></li>
<li>Move SSL API comments to header files. Move the documentation of the SSL API calls are supposed to do into the headers files, instead of keeping them in the files for the OpenSSL implementation. That way, they don't have to be duplicated or be inconsistent when other implementations are added. <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/f966101d19fcef6441e43da417467b3ed5ad3074">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/f966101d19fcef6441e43da417467b3ed5ad3074</a></li>
<li>pgbench: Remove accidental garbage in test file. Author: Fabien COELHO &lt;coelho@cri.ensmp.fr&gt; <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/f9bbd46adbf350ba9e99a808f2c759e4aab9ea70">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/f9bbd46adbf350ba9e99a808f2c759e4aab9ea70</a></li>
<li>Add tests for record_image_eq and record_image_cmp. record_image_eq was covered a bit by the materialized view code that it is meant to support, but record_image_cmp was not tested at all. While we're here, add more tests to record_eq and record_cmp as well, for symmetry. Reviewed-by: Michael Paquier &lt;michael.paquier@gmail.com&gt; <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a61116da8b99c4ff4b8c5757697abda7ac36b022">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a61116da8b99c4ff4b8c5757697abda7ac36b022</a></li>
<li>Allow spaces in connection strings in SSL tests. Connection strings can have items with spaces in them, wrapped in quotes. The tests however ran a SELECT '$connstr' upon connection which broke on the embedded quotes. Use dollar quotes on the connstr to protect against this. This was hit during the development of the macOS Secure Transport patch, but is independent of it. Author: Daniel Gustafsson &lt;daniel@yesql.se&gt; <a target="_blank" href="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/4a3fdbdf766d80b21271e32da865801ab005d786">https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/4a3fdbdf766d80b21271e32da865801ab005d786</a></li>
<li>Remove use of byte-masking macros in record_image_cmp. These were introduced in 4cbb646334b3b998a29abef0d57608d42097e6c9, but after further analysis and testing, they should not be necessary and probably weren't the part of that commit that fixed anything.

<li>Update documentation to mention huge pages on other OSes. Previously, the docs implied that only Linux and Windows could use huge pages.

<li>Make pg_dump's ACL, sec label, and comment entries reliably identifiable. _tocEntryRequired() expects that it can identify ACL, SECURITY LABEL, and COMMENT TOC entries that are for large objects by seeing whether the tag for them starts with "LARGE OBJECT ". While that works fine for actual large objects, which are indeed tagged that way, it's subject to false positives unless every such entry's tag starts with an appropriate type ID. And in fact it does not work for ACLs, because up to now we customarily tagged those entries with just the bare name of the object. This means that an ACL for an object named "LARGE OBJECT something" would be misclassified as data not schema, with undesirable results in a schema-only or data-only dump --- although pg_upgrade seems unaffected, due to the special case for binary-upgrade mode further down in _tocEntryRequired(). We can fix this by changing all the dumpACL calls to use the label strings already in use for comments and security labels, which do follow the convention of starting with an object type indicator. Well, mostly they follow it. dumpDatabase() got it wrong, using just the bare database name for those purposes, so that a database named "LARGE OBJECT something" would similarly be subject to having its comment or security label dropped or included when not wanted. Bring that into line too. (Note that up to now, database ACLs have not been processed by pg_dump, so that this issue doesn't affect them.) _tocEntryRequired() itself is not free of fault: it was overly liberal about matching object tags to "LARGE OBJECT " in binary-upgrade mode. This looks like it is probably harmless because there would be no data component to strip anyway in that mode, but at best it's trouble waiting to happen, so tighten that up too. The possible misclassification of SECURITY LABEL entries for databases is in principle a security problem, but the opportunities for actual exploits seem too narrow to be interesting. The other cases seem like just bugs, since an object owner can change its ACL or comment for himself, he needn't try to trick someone else into doing it by choosing a strange name. This has been broken since per-large-object TOC entries were introduced in 9.0, so back-patch to all supported branches.

<li>Reorder code in pg_dump to dump comments etc in a uniform order. Most of the code in pg_dump dumps an object's comment, security label, and ACL auxiliary TOC entries, in that order, immediately after the object's main TOC entry, and at least dumpComment's API spec says this isn't optional. dumpDatabase was significantly violating that when in binary-upgrade mode, by inserting totally unrelated stuff between. Also, dumpForeignDataWrapper and dumpForeignServer were being randomly inconsistent. Reorder code so everybody does it the same. This may be future-proofing us against some code growing a requirement for such auxiliary entries to be adjacent to their main entry. But for now it's just neatnik-ism, so I see no need for back-patch.

<li>Move handling of database properties from pg_dumpall into pg_dump. This patch rearranges the division of labor between pg_dump and pg_dumpall so that pg_dump itself handles all properties attached to a single database. Notably, a database's ACL (GRANT/REVOKE status) and local GUC settings established by ALTER DATABASE SET and ALTER ROLE IN DATABASE SET can be dumped and restored by pg_dump. This is a long-requested improvement. "pg_dumpall -g" will now produce only role- and tablespace-related output, nothing about individual databases. The total output of a regular pg_dumpall run remains the same. pg_dump (or pg_restore) will restore database-level properties only when creating the target database with --create. This applies not only to ACLs and GUCs but to the other database properties it already handled, that is database comments and security labels. This is more consistent and useful, but does represent an incompatibility in the behavior seen without --create. (This change makes the proposed patch to have pg_dump use "COMMENT ON DATABASE CURRENT_DATABASE" unnecessary, since there is no case where the command is issued that we won't know the true name of the database. We might still want that patch as a feature in its own right, but pg_dump no longer needs it.) pg_dumpall with --clean will now drop and recreate the "postgres" and "template1" databases in the target cluster, allowing their locale and encoding settings to be changed if necessary, and providing a cleaner way to set nondefault tablespaces for them than we had before. This means that such a script must now always be started in the "postgres" database; the order of drops and reconnects will not work otherwise. Without --clean, the script will not adjust any database-level properties of those two databases (including their comments, ACLs, and security labels, which it formerly would try to set). Another minor incompatibility is that the CREATE DATABASE commands in a pg_dumpall script will now always specify locale and encoding settings. Formerly those would be omitted if they matched the cluster's default. While that behavior had some usefulness in some migration scenarios, it also posed a significant hazard of unwanted locale/encoding changes. To migrate to another locale/encoding, it's now necessary to use pg_dump without --create to restore into a database with the desired settings. Commit 4bd371f6f's hack to emit "SET default_transaction_read_only = off" is gone: we now dodge that problem by the expedient of not issuing ALTER DATABASE SET commands until after reconnecting to the target database. Therefore, such settings won't apply during the restore session. In passing, improve some shaky grammar in the docs, and add a note pointing out that pg_dumpall's output can't be expected to load without any errors. (Someday we might want to fix that, but this is not that patch.) Haribabu Kommi, reviewed at various times by Andreas Karlsson, Vaishnavi Prabakaran, and Robert Haas; further hacking by me.

<li>In pg_dump, force reconnection after issuing ALTER DATABASE SET command(s). The folly of not doing this was exposed by the buildfarm: in some cases, the GUC settings applied through ALTER DATABASE SET may be essential to interpreting the reloaded data correctly. Another argument why we can't really get away with the scheme proposed in commit b3f840120 is that it cannot work for parallel restore: even if the parent process manages to hang onto the previous GUC state, worker processes would see the state post-ALTER-DATABASE. (Perhaps we could have dodged that bullet by delaying DATABASE PROPERTIES restoration to the end of the run, but that does nothing for the data semantics problem.) This leaves us with no solution for the default_transaction_read_only issue that commit 4bd371f6f intended to work around, other than "you gotta remove such settings before dumping/upgrading". However, in view of the fact that parallel restore broke that hack years ago and no one has noticed, it's fair to question how many people care. I'm unexcited about adding a large dollop of new complexity to handle that corner case. This would be a one-liner fix, except it turns out that ReconnectToServer tries to optimize away "redundant" reconnections. While that may have been valuable when coded, a quick survey of current callers shows that there are no cases where that's actually useful, so just remove that check. While at it, remove the function's useless return value.

<li>Teach reparameterize_path() to handle AppendPaths. If we're inside a lateral subquery, there may be no unparameterized paths for a particular child relation of an appendrel, in which case we *must* be able to create similarly-parameterized paths for each other child relation, else the planner will fail with "could not devise a query plan for the given query". This means that there are situations where we'd better be able to reparameterize at least one path for each child. This calls into question the assumption in reparameterize_path() that it can just punt if it feels like it. However, the only case that is known broken right now is where the child is itself an appendrel so that all its paths are AppendPaths. (I think possibly I disregarded that in the original coding on the theory that nested appendrels would get folded together --- but that only happens *after* reparameterize_path(), so it's not excused from handling a child AppendPath.) Given that this code's been like this since 9.3 when LATERAL was introduced, it seems likely we'd have heard of other cases by now if there were a larger problem. Per report from Elvis Pranskevichus. Back-patch to 9.3.

<li>Improve implementation of pg_attribute_always_inline. Avoid compiler warnings on MSVC (which doesn't want to see both __forceinline and inline) and ancient GCC (which doesn't have __attribute__((always_inline))). Don't force inline-ing when building at -O0, as the programmer is probably hoping for exact source-to-object-line correspondence in that case. (For the moment this only works for GCC; maybe we can extend it later.) Make pg_attribute_always_inline be syntactically a drop-in replacement for inline, rather than an additional wart.

<li>Improve pg_dump's handling of "special" built-in objects. We had some pretty ad-hoc handling of the public schema and the plpgsql extension, which are both presumed to exist in template0 but might be modified or deleted in the database being dumped. Up to now, by default pg_dump would emit a CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS command as well as a COMMENT command for plpgsql. The usefulness of the former is questionable, and the latter caused annoying errors in non-superuser dump/restore scenarios. Let's instead install a rule that built-in extensions (identified by having low-numbered OIDs) are not to be dumped. We were doing it that way already in binary-upgrade mode, so this just makes regular mode behave the same. It remains true that if someone has installed a non-default ACL on the plpgsql language, that will get dumped thanks to the pg_init_privs mechanism. This is more consistent with the handling of built-in objects of other kinds. Also, change the very ad-hoc mechanism that was used to avoid dumping creation and comment commands for the public schema. Instead of hardwiring a test in _printTocEntry(), make use of the DUMP_COMPONENT_ infrastructure to mark that schema up-front about what we want to do with it. This has the visible effect that the public schema won't be mentioned in the output at all, except for updating its ACL if it has a non-default ACL. Previously, while it was normally not mentioned, --clean mode would drop and recreate it, again causing headaches for non-superuser usage. This change likewise makes the public schema less special and more like other built-in objects. If plpgsql, or the public schema, has been removed entirely in the source DB, that situation won't be reproduced in the destination ... but that was true before.

<li>Clean up some aspects of pg_dump/pg_restore item-selection logic. Ensure that CREATE DATABASE and related commands are issued when, and only when, --create is specified. Previously there were scenarios where using selective-dump switches would prevent --create from having any effect. For example, it would fail to do anything in pg_restore if the archive file had been made by a selective dump, because there would be no TOC entry for the database. Since we don't issue \connect either if we don't issue CREATE DATABASE, this could result in unexpectedly restoring objects into the wrong database. Also fix pg_restore's selective restore logic so that when an object is selected to be restored, we also restore its ACL, comment, and security label if any. Previously there was no way to get the latter properties except through tedious mucking about with a -L file. If, for some reason, you don't want these properties, you can match the old behavior by adding --no-acl etc. While at it, try to make _tocEntryRequired() a little better organized and better documented.

<li>Support --no-comments in pg_dump, pg_dumpall, pg_restore. We have switches already to suppress other subsidiary object properties, such as ACLS, security labels, ownership, and tablespaces, so just on the grounds of symmetry we should allow suppressing comments as well. Also, commit 0d4e6ed30 added a positive reason to have this feature, i.e. to allow obtaining the old behavior of selective pg_restore should anyone desire that. Recent commits have removed the cases where pg_dump emitted comments on built-in objects that the restoring user might not have privileges to comment on, so the original primary motivation for this feature is gone, but it still seems at least somewhat useful in its own right.

<li>Remove the obsolete WITH clause of CREATE FUNCTION. This clause was superseded by SQL-standard syntax back in 7.3. We've kept it around for backwards-compatibility purposes ever since; but 15 years seems like long enough for that, especially seeing that there are undocumented weirdnesses in how it interacts with the SQL-standard syntax for specifying the same options. Michael Paquier, per an observation by Daniel Gustafsson; some small cosmetic adjustments to nearby code by me.

<li>Avoid unnecessary use of pg_strcasecmp for already-downcased identifiers. We have a lot of code in which option names, which from the user's viewpoint are logically keywords, are passed through the grammar as plain identifiers, and then matched to string literals during command execution. This approach avoids making words into lexer keywords unnecessarily. Some places matched these strings using plain strcmp, some using pg_strcasecmp. But the latter should be unnecessary since identifiers would have been downcased on their way through the parser. Aside from any efficiency concerns (probably not a big factor), the lack of consistency in this area creates a hazard of subtle bugs due to different places coming to different conclusions about whether two option names are the same or different. Hence, standardize on using strcmp() to match any option names that are expected to have been fed through the parser. This does create a user-visible behavioral change, which is that while formerly all of these would work: alter table foo set (fillfactor = 50); alter table foo set (FillFactor = 50); alter table foo set ("fillfactor" = 50); alter table foo set ("FillFactor" = 50); now the last case will fail because that double-quoted identifier is different from the others. However, none of our documentation says that you can use a quoted identifier in such contexts at all, and we should discourage doing so since it would break if we ever decide to parse such constructs as true lexer keywords rather than poor man's substitutes. So this shouldn't create a significant compatibility issue for users.

<li>Avoid crash during EvalPlanQual recheck of an inner indexscan. Commit 09529a70b changed nodeIndexscan.c and nodeIndexonlyscan.c to postpone initialization of the indexscan proper until the first tuple fetch. It overlooked the question of mark/restore behavior, which means that if some caller attempts to mark the scan before the first tuple fetch, you get a null pointer dereference. The only existing user of mark/restore is nodeMergejoin.c, which (somewhat accidentally) will never attempt to set a mark before the first inner tuple unless the inner child node is a Material node. Hence the case can't arise normally, so it seems sufficient to document the assumption at both ends. However, during an EvalPlanQual recheck, ExecScanFetch doesn't call IndexNext but just returns the jammed-in test tuple. Therefore, if we're doing a recheck in a plan tree with a mergejoin with inner indexscan, it's possible to reach ExecIndexMarkPos with iss_ScanDesc still null, as reported by Guo Xiang Tan in bug #15032. Really, when there's a test tuple supplied during an EPQ recheck, touching the index at all is the wrong thing: rather, the behavior of mark/restore ought to amount to saving and restoring the es_epqScanDone flag. We can avoid finding a place to actually save the flag, for the moment, because given the assumption that no caller will set a mark before fetching a tuple, es_epqScanDone must always be set by the time we try to mark. So the actual behavior change required is just to not reach the index access if a test tuple is supplied. The set of plan node types that need to consider this issue are those that support EPQ test tuples (i.e., call ExecScan()) and also support mark/restore; which is to say, IndexScan, IndexOnlyScan, and perhaps CustomScan. It's tempting to try to fix the problem in one place by teaching ExecMarkPos() itself about EPQ; but ExecMarkPos supports some plan types that aren't Scans, and also it seems risky to make assumptions about what a CustomScan wants to do here. Also, the most likely future change here is to decide that we do need to support marks placed before the first tuple, which would require additional work in IndexScan and IndexOnlyScan in any case. Hence, fix the EPQ issue in nodeIndexscan.c and nodeIndexonlyscan.c, accepting the small amount of code duplicated thereby, and leave it to CustomScan providers to fix this bug if they have it. Back-patch to v10 where commit 09529a70b came in. In earlier branches, the index_markpos() call is a waste of cycles when EPQ is active, but no more than that, so it doesn't seem appropriate to back-patch further.

<li>Add stack-overflow guards in set-operation planning. create_plan_recurse lacked any stack depth check. This is not per our normal coding rules, but I'd supposed it was safe because earlier planner processing is more complex and presumably should eat more stack. But bug #15033 from Andrew Grossman shows this isn't true, at least not for queries having the form of a many-thousand-way INTERSECT stack. Further testing showed that recurse_set_operations is also capable of being crashed in this way, since it likewise will recurse to the bottom of a parsetree before calling any support functions that might themselves contain any stack checks. However, its stack consumption is only perhaps a third of create_plan_recurse's. It's possible that this particular problem with create_plan_recurse can only manifest in 9.6 and later, since before that we didn't build a Path tree for set operations. But having seen this example, I now have no faith in the proposition that create_plan_recurse doesn't need a stack check, so back-patch to all supported branches.

<li>Report an ERROR if a parallel worker fails to start properly. Commit 28724fd90d2f85a0573a8107b48abad062a86d83 fixed things so that if a background worker fails to start due to fork() failure or because it is terminated before startup succeeds, BGWH_STOPPED will be reported. However, that only helps if the code that uses the background worker machinery notices the change in status, and the code in parallel.c did not. To fix that, do two things. First, make sure that when a worker exits, it triggers the leader to read from error queues. That way, if a worker which has attached to an error queue exits uncleanly, the leader is sure to throw some error, either the contents of the ErrorResponse sent by the worker, or "lost connection to parallel worker" if it exited without sending one. To cover the case where the worker never starts up in the first place or exits before attaching to the error queue, the ParallelContext now keeps track of which workers have sent at least one message via the error queue. A worker which sends no messages by the time the parallel operation finishes will be checked to see whether it exited before attaching to the error queue; if so, a new error message, "parallel worker failed to initialize", will be reported. If not, we'll continue to wait until it either starts up and exits cleanly, starts up and exits uncleanly, or fails to start, and then take the appropriate action. Patch by me, reviewed by Amit Kapila.

<li>Factor some code out of create_grouping_paths. This is preparatory refactoring to prepare the way for partition-wise aggregate, which will reuse the new subroutines for child grouping rels.

<li>Ignore partitioned indexes where appropriate. get_relation_info() was too optimistic about opening indexes in partitioned tables, which would raise errors when any queries were planned on such tables. Fix by ignoring any indexes of the partitioned kind. CLUSTER (and ALTER TABLE CLUSTER ON) had a similar problem. Fix by disallowing these commands in partitioned tables.
