    <div class="post-content"><h2>Correctifs appliqu&eacute;s</h2>
<p>Tom Lane pushed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean up dubious code in contrib/seg. The restore() function assumed that the result of sprintf() with %e format would necessarily contain an 'e', which is false: what if the supplied number is an infinity or NaN? If that did happen, we'd get a null-pointer-dereference core dump. The case appears impossible currently, because seg_in() does not accept such values, and there are no seg-creating functions that would create one. But it seems unwise to rely on it never happening in future. Quite aside from that, the code was pretty ugly: it relied on modifying a static format string when it could use a "*" precision argument, and it used strtok() entirely gratuitously, and it stripped off trailing spaces by hand instead of just not asking for them to begin with. Coverity noticed the potential null pointer dereference (though I wonder why it didn't complain years ago, since this code is ancient). Since this is just code cleanup and forestalling a hypothetical future bug, there seems no need for back-patching. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a75a418d07bf852dc9fdb85ccfb39c763aa057a9">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a75a418d07bf852dc9fdb85ccfb39c763aa057a9</a></li>
<li>Fix latent portability issue in pgwin32_dispatch_queued_signals(). The first iteration of the signal-checking loop would compute sigmask(0) which expands to 1&lt;&lt;(-1) which is undefined behavior according to the C standard. The lack of field reports of trouble suggest that it evaluates to 0 on all existing Windows compilers, but that's hardly something to rely on. Since signal 0 isn't a queueable signal anyway, we can just make the loop iterate from 1 instead, and save a few cycles as well as avoiding the undefined behavior. In passing, avoid evaluating the volatile expression UNBLOCKED_SIGNAL_QUEUE twice in a row; there's no reason to waste cycles like that. Noted by Aleksander Alekseev, though this isn't his proposed fix. Back-patch to all supported branches. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/58666ed28ab59a2686ee08bc648b4e9959aacfce">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/58666ed28ab59a2686ee08bc648b4e9959aacfce</a></li>
<li>Introduce a LOG_SERVER_ONLY ereport level, which is never sent to client. This elevel is useful for logging audit messages and similar information that should not be passed to the client. It's equivalent to LOG in terms of decisions about logging priority in the postmaster log, but messages with this elevel will never be sent to the client. In the current implementation, it's just an alias for the longstanding COMMERROR elevel (or more accurately, we've made COMMERROR an alias for this). At some point it might be interesting to allow a LOG_ONLY flag to be attached to any elevel, but that would be considerably more complicated, and it's not clear there's enough use-cases to justify the extra work. For now, let's just take the easy 90% solution. David Steele, reviewed by Fabien Coelho, Petr Jel&Atilde;&shy;nek, and myself <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/66229ac0040cf1e0f5b9d72271aa9feaf3b3a37e">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/66229ac0040cf1e0f5b9d72271aa9feaf3b3a37e</a></li>
<li>Add a \gexec command to psql for evaluation of computed queries. \gexec executes the just-entered query, like \g, but instead of printing the results it takes each field as a SQL command to send to the server. Computing a series of queries to be executed is a fairly common thing, but up to now you always had to resort to kluges like writing the queries to a file and then inputting the file. Now it can be done with no intermediate step. The implementation is fairly straightforward except for its interaction with FETCH_COUNT. ExecQueryUsingCursor isn't capable of being called recursively, and even if it were, its need to create a transaction block interferes unpleasantly with the desired behavior of \gexec after a failure of a generated query (i.e., that it can continue). Therefore, disable use of ExecQueryUsingCursor when doing the master \gexec query. We can still apply it to individual generated queries, however, and there might be some value in doing so. While testing this feature's interaction with single-step mode, I (tgl) was led to conclude that SendQuery needs to recognize SIGINT (cancel_pressed) as a negative response to the single-step prompt. Perhaps that's a back-patchable bug fix, but for now I just included it here. Corey Huinker, reviewed by Jim Nasby, Daniel V&Atilde;&copy;rit&Atilde;&copy;, and myself <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/2bbe9112aec60abc2d3b4c39e75d0cbdcaaa45e1">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/2bbe9112aec60abc2d3b4c39e75d0cbdcaaa45e1</a></li>
<li>Add a few comments about ANALYZE's strategy for collecting MCVs. Alex Shulgin complained that the underlying strategy wasn't all that apparent, particularly not the fact that we intentionally have two code paths depending on whether we think the column has a limited set of possible values or not. Try to make it clearer. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/3c69b33f459f62fe6db66c386ef12620ea697f74">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/3c69b33f459f62fe6db66c386ef12620ea697f74</a></li>
<li>Partially revert commit 3d3bf62f30200500637b24fdb7b992a99f9704c3. On reflection, the pre-existing logic in ANALYZE is specifically meant to compare the frequency of a candidate MCV against the estimated frequency of a random distinct value across the whole table. The change to compare it against the average frequency of values actually seen in the sample doesn't seem very principled, and if anything it would make us less likely not more likely to consider a value an MCV. So revert that, but keep the aspect of considering only nonnull values, which definitely is correct. In passing, rename the local variables in these stanzas to "ndistinct_table", to avoid confusion with the "ndistinct" that appears at an outer scope in compute_scalar_stats. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/391159e03a8b69dd04a1432ceb800c7c4c3d608c">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/391159e03a8b69dd04a1432ceb800c7c4c3d608c</a></li>
<li>Disallow newlines in parameter values to be set in ALTER SYSTEM. As noted by Julian Schauder in bug #14063, the configuration-file parser doesn't support embedded newlines in string literals. While there might someday be a good reason to remove that restriction, there doesn't seem to be one right now. However, ALTER SYSTEM SET could accept strings containing newlines, since many of the variable-specific value-checking routines would just see a newline as whitespace. This led to writing a postgresql.auto.conf file that was broken and had to be removed manually. Pending a reason to work harder, just throw an error if someone tries this. In passing, fix several places in the ALTER SYSTEM logic that failed to provide an errcode() for an ereport(), and thus would falsely log the failure as an internal XX000 error. Back-patch to 9.4 where ALTER SYSTEM was introduced. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/99f3b5613bd1f145b5dbbe86000337bbe37fb094">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/99f3b5613bd1f145b5dbbe86000337bbe37fb094</a></li>
<li>Fix PL/Python for recursion and interleaved set-returning functions. PL/Python failed if a PL/Python function was invoked recursively via SPI, since arguments are passed to the function in its global dictionary (a horrible decision that's far too ancient to undo) and it would delete those dictionary entries on function exit, leaving the outer recursion level(s) without any arguments. Not deleting them would be little better, since the outer levels would then see the innermost level's arguments. Since PL/Python uses ValuePerCall mode for evaluating set-returning functions, it's possible for multiple executions of the same SRF to be interleaved within a query. PL/Python failed in such a case, because it stored only one iterator per function, directly in the function's PLyProcedure struct. Moreover, one interleaved instance of the SRF would see argument values that should belong to another. Hence, invent code for saving and restoring the argument entries. To fix the recursion case, we only need to save at recursive entry and restore at recursive exit, so the overhead in non-recursive cases is negligible. To fix the SRF case, we have to save when suspending a SRF and restore when resuming it, which is potentially not negligible; but fortunately this is mostly a matter of manipulating Python object refcounts and should not involve much physical data copying. Also, store the Python iterator and saved argument values in a structure associated with the SRF call site rather than the function itself. This requires adding a memory context deletion callback to ensure that the SRF state is cleaned up if the calling query exits before running the SRF to completion. Without that we'd leak a refcount to the iterator object in such a case, resulting in session-lifespan memory leakage. (In the pre-existing code, there was no memory leak because there was only one iterator pointer, but what would happen is that the previous iterator would be resumed by the next query attempting to use the SRF. Hardly the semantics we want.) We can buy back some of whatever overhead we've added by getting rid of PLy_function_delete_args(), which seems a useless activity: there is no need to delete argument entries from the global dictionary on exit, since the next time anyone would see the global dict is on the next fresh call of the PL/Python function, at which time we'd overwrite those entries with new arg values anyway. Also clean up some really ugly coding in the SRF implementation, including such gems as returning directly out of a PG_TRY block. (The only reason that failed to crash hard was that all existing call sites immediately exited their own PG_TRY blocks, popping the dangling longjmp pointer before there was any chance of it being used.) In principle this is a bug fix; but it seems a bit too invasive relative to its value for a back-patch, and besides the fix depends on memory context callbacks so it could not go back further than 9.5 anyway. Alexey Grishchenko and Tom Lane <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/1d2fe56e42640613781fc17ab1534fd0551de9bd">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/1d2fe56e42640613781fc17ab1534fd0551de9bd</a></li>
<li>Run pgindent on a batch of (mostly-planner-related) source files. Getting annoyed at the amount of unrelated chatter I get from pgindent'ing Rowley's unique-joins patch. Re-indent all the files it touches. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/de94e2af184e25576b13cbda8cf825118835d1cd">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/de94e2af184e25576b13cbda8cf825118835d1cd</a></li>
<li>Refactor join_is_removable() to separate out distinctness-proving logic. Extracted from pending unique-join patch, since this is a rather large delta but it's simply moving code out into separately-accessible subroutines. I (tgl) did choose to add a bit more logic to rel_supports_distinctness, so that it verifies that there's at least one potentially usable unique index rather than just checking indexlist != NIL. Otherwise there's no functional change here. David Rowley <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/f338dd7585cab45da9053e883ad65a440a99d3be">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/f338dd7585cab45da9053e883ad65a440a99d3be</a></li>
<li>Fix multiple bugs in tablespace symlink removal. Don't try to examine S_ISLNK(st.st_mode) after a failed lstat(). It's undefined. Also, if the lstat() reported ENOENT, we do not wish that to be a hard error, but the code might nonetheless treat it as one (giving an entirely misleading error message, too) depending on luck-of-the-draw as to what S_ISLNK() returned. Don't throw error for ENOENT from rmdir(), either. (We're not really expecting ENOENT because we just stat'd the file successfully; but if we're going to allow ENOENT in the symlink code path, surely the directory code path should too.) Generate an appropriate errcode for its-the-wrong-type-of-file complaints.

<li>Micro-optimize GenericXLogFinish(). Make the inner comparison loops of computeDelta() as tight as possible by pulling considerations of valid and invalid ranges out of the inner loops, and extending a match or non-match detection as far as possible before deciding what to do next. To keep this tractable, give up the possibility of merging fragments across the pd_lower to pd_upper gap. The fraction of pages where that could happen (ie, there are 4 or fewer bytes in the gap, *and* data changes immediately adjacent to it on both sides) is too small to be worth spending cycles on. Also, avoid two BLCKSZ-length memcpy()s by computing the delta before moving data into the target buffer, instead of after. This doesn't save nearly as many cycles as being tenser about computeDelta(), but it still seems worth doing. On my machine, this patch cuts a full 40% off the runtime of contrib/bloom's regression test. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/68689c66efcda6f217119432edfbdf95a50b26e2">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/68689c66efcda6f217119432edfbdf95a50b26e2</a></li>
<li>Further minor improvement in generic_xlog.c: always say REGBUF_STANDARD. Since we're requiring pages handled by generic_xlog.c to be standard format, specify REGBUF_STANDARD when doing a full-page image, so that xloginsert.c can compress out the "hole" between pd_lower and pd_upper. Given the current API in which this path will be taken only for a newly initialized page, the hole is likely to be particularly large in such cases, so that this oversight could easily be performance-significant. I don't notice any particular change in the runtime of contrib/bloom's regression test, though. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/660d5fb856c61df2de2cedb26249404ffc58cb89">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/660d5fb856c61df2de2cedb26249404ffc58cb89</a></li>
<li>Improve contrib/bloom regression test using code coverage info. Originally, this test created a 100000-row test table, which made it run rather slowly compared to other contrib tests. Investigation with gcov showed that we got no further improvement in code coverage after the first 700 or so rows, making the large table 99% a waste of time. Cut it back to 2000 rows to fix the runtime problem and still leave some headroom for testing behaviors that may appear later. A closer look at the gcov results showed that the main coverage omissions in contrib/bloom occurred because the test never filled more than one entry in the notFullPage array; which is unsurprising because it exercised index cleanup only in the scenario of complete table deletion, allowing every page in the index to become deleted rather than not-full. Add testing that allows the not-full path to be exercised as well. Also, test the amvalidate function, because blvalidate.c had zero coverage without that, and besides it's a good idea to check for mistakes in the bloom opclass definitions. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/cf223c3bf5ba16232147c66b5fef4037aafe747c">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/cf223c3bf5ba16232147c66b5fef4037aafe747c</a></li>
<li>Fix access-to-already-freed-memory issue in plpython's error handling. PLy_elog() could attempt to access strings that Python had already freed, because the strings that PLy_get_spi_error_data() returns are simply pointers into storage associated with the error "val" PyObject. That's fine at the instant PLy_get_spi_error_data() returns them, but just after that PLy_traceback() intentionally releases the only refcount on that object, allowing it to be freed --- so that the strings we pass to ereport() are dangling pointers. In principle this could result in garbage output or a coredump. In practice, I think the risk is pretty low, because there are no Python operations between where we decrement that refcount and where we use the strings (and copy them into PG storage), and thus no reason for Python to recycle the storage. Still, it's clearly hazardous, and it leads to Valgrind complaints when running under a Valgrind that hasn't been lobotomized to ignore Python memory allocations. The code was a mess anyway: we fetched the error data out of Python (clearing Python's error indicator) with PyErr_Fetch, examined it, pushed it back into Python with PyErr_Restore (re-setting the error indicator), then immediately pulled it back out with another PyErr_Fetch. Just to confuse matters even more, there were some gratuitous-and-yet-hazardous PyErr_Clear calls in the "examine" step, and we didn't get around to doing PyErr_NormalizeException until after the second PyErr_Fetch, making it even less clear which object was being manipulated where and whether we still had a refcount on it. (If PyErr_NormalizeException did substitute a different "val" object, it's possible that the problem could manifest for real, because then we'd be doing assorted Python stuff with no refcount on the object we have string pointers into.) So, rearrange all that into some semblance of sanity, and don't decrement the refcount on the Python error objects until the end of PLy_elog(). In HEAD, I failed to resist the temptation to reformat some messy bits from 5c3c3cd0a3046339 along the way. Back-patch as far as 9.2, because the code is substantially the same that far back. I believe that 9.1 has the bug as well; but the code around it is rather different and I don't want to take a chance on breaking something for what seems a low-probability problem. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/7e3bb080387f4143cdc908bf97daf9a8abdc445f">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/7e3bb080387f4143cdc908bf97daf9a8abdc445f</a></li>
<li>Clean up foreign-key caching code in planner. Coverity complained that the code added by 015e88942aa50f0d lacked an error check for SearchSysCache1 failures, which it should have.

<li>pg_dump: add missing "destroyPQExpBuffer(query)" in dumpForeignServer(). Coverity complained about this resource leak (why now, I don't know, since it's been like that a long time). Our general policy in pg_dump is that PQExpBuffers are worth cleaning up, so do it here too. But don't bother with a back-patch, because it seems unlikely that very many databases contain enough FOREIGN SERVER objects to notice. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/074050f16a2db9b5ebe5c9f8fdb211cbb810e746">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/074050f16a2db9b5ebe5c9f8fdb211cbb810e746</a></li>

<li>Fix poorly thought-through code from commit 5c3c3cd0a3046339. It's not entirely clear to me whether PyString_AsString can return null (looks like the answer might vary between Python 2 and 3). But in any case, this code's attempt to cope with the possibility was quite broken, because pstrdup() neither allows a null argument nor ever returns a null. Moreover, the code below this point assumes that "message" is a palloc'd string, which would not be the case for a dgettext result. Fix both problems by doing the pstrdup step separately. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/f73b2bbbdcb387aa90ff619fe03d1924ed82b868">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/f73b2bbbdcb387aa90ff619fe03d1924ed82b868</a></li>

<li>Improve estimate of distinct values in estimate_num_groups(). When adjusting the estimate for the number of distinct values from a rel in a grouped query to take into account the selectivity of the rel's restrictions, use a formula that is less likely to produce under-estimates. The old formula simply multiplied the number of distinct values in the rel by the restriction selectivity, which would be correct if the restrictions were fully correlated with the grouping expressions, but can produce significant under-estimates in cases where they are not well correlated. The new formula is based on the random selection probability, and so assumes that the restrictions are not correlated with the grouping expressions. This is guaranteed to produce larger estimates, and of course risks over-estimating in cases where the restrictions are correlated, but that has less severe consequences than under-estimating, which might lead to a HashAgg that consumes an excessive amount of memory. This could possibly be improved upon in the future by identifying correlated restrictions and using a hybrid of the old and new formulae.

<li>pg_dump: Add table qualifications to some tags. Some object types have names that are only unique for one table. But for those we generally didn't put the table name into the dump TOC tag. So it was impossible to identify these objects if the same name was used for multiple tables. This affects policies, column defaults, constraints, triggers, and rules. Fix by adding the table name to the TOC tag, so that it now reads "$schema $table $object".

<li>Distrust external OpenSSL clients; clear err queue. OpenSSL has an unfortunate tendency to mix per-session state error handling with per-thread error handling. This can cause problems when programs that link to libpq with OpenSSL enabled have some other use of OpenSSL; without care, one caller of OpenSSL may cause problems for the other caller. Backend code might similarly be affected, for example when a third party extension independently uses OpenSSL without taking the appropriate precautions. To fix, don't trust other users of OpenSSL to clear the per-thread error queue. Instead, clear the entire per-thread queue ahead of certain I/O operations when it appears that there might be trouble (these I/O operations mostly need to call SSL_get_error() to check for success, which relies on the queue being empty). This is slightly aggressive, but it's pretty clear that the other callers have a very dubious claim to ownership of the per-thread queue. Do this is both frontend and backend code. Finally, be more careful about clearing our own error queue, so as to not cause these problems ourself. It's possibly that control previously did not always reach SSLerrmessage(), where ERR_get_error() was supposed to be called to clear the queue's earliest code. Make sure ERR_get_error() is always called, so as to spare other users of OpenSSL the possibility of similar problems caused by libpq (as opposed to problems caused by a third party OpenSSL library like PHP's OpenSSL extension). Again, do this is both frontend and backend code.

<li>Implement backup API functions for non-exclusive backups. Previously non-exclusive backups had to be done using the replication protocol and pg_basebackup. With this commit it's now possible to make them using pg_start_backup/pg_stop_backup as well, as long as the backup program can maintain a persistent connection to the database. Doing this, backup_label and tablespace_map are returned as results from pg_stop_backup() instead of being written to the data directory. This makes the server safe from a crash during an ongoing backup, which can be a problem with exclusive backups. The old syntax of the functions remain and work exactly as before, but since the new syntax is safer this should eventually be deprecated and removed. Only reference documentation is included. The main section on backup still needs to be rewritten to cover this, but since that is already scheduled for a separate large rewrite, it's not included in this patch.

<li>Support multiple synchronous standby servers. Previously synchronous replication offered only the ability to confirm that all changes made by a transaction had been transferred to at most one synchronous standby server. This commit extends synchronous replication so that it supports multiple synchronous standby servers. It enables users to consider one or more standby servers as synchronous, and increase the level of transaction durability by ensuring that transaction commits wait for replies from all of those synchronous standbys. Multiple synchronous standby servers are configured in synchronous_standby_names which is extended to support new syntax of 'num_sync ( standby_name [ , ... ] )', where num_sync specifies the number of synchronous standbys that transaction commits need to wait for replies from and standby_name is the name of a standby server. The syntax of 'standby_name [ , ... ]' which was used in 9.5 or before is also still supported. It's the same as new syntax with num_sync=1. This commit doesn't include "quorum commit" feature which was discussed in pgsql-hackers. Synchronous standbys are chosen based on their priorities. synchronous_standby_names determines the priority of each standby for being chosen as a synchronous standby. The standbys whose names appear earlier in the list are given higher priority and will be considered as synchronous. Other standby servers appearing later in this list represent potential synchronous standbys. The regression test for multiple synchronous standbys is not included in this commit. It should come later.

The original values are tracked in pg_init_privs. When pg_dump'ing 9.6-and-above databases, we will dump out the ACLs for all objects in pg_catalog and the ACLs for all extension members, where the ACL has been changed from the original value which was set during either initdb or CREATE EXTENSION.

No behavior change here, but in preparation for a change where we will dump out just the ACLs of objects in pg_catalog, but we might not dump out the ACL of the pg_catalog namespace itself (for instance, when it hasn't been changed from the value set at initdb time).

Using these roles instead of granting superuser access reduces the number of superuser roles required for a system. Documention for each of the default roles has been added to user-manag.sgml. Bump catversion to 201604082, as we had a commit that bumped it to 201604081 and another that set it back to 201604071...

<li>Reserve the "pg_" namespace for roles. This will prevent users from creating roles which begin with "pg_" and will check for those roles before allowing an upgrade using pg_upgrade.

<li>Standardize GetTokenInformation() error reporting. Commit c22650cd6450854e1a75064b698d7dcbb4a8821a sparked a discussion about diverse interpretations of "token user" in error messages. Expel old and new specimens of that phrase by making all GetTokenInformation() callers report errors the way GetTokenUser() has been reporting them. These error conditions almost can't happen, so users are unlikely to observe this change.

<li>Detect SSI conflicts before reporting constraint violations. While prior to this patch the user-visible effect on the database of any set of successfully committed serializable transactions was always consistent with some one-at-a-time order of execution of those transactions, the presence of declarative constraints could allow errors to occur which were not possible in any such ordering, and developers had no good workarounds to prevent user-facing errors where they were not necessary or desired. This patch adds a check for serialization failure ahead of duplicate key checking so that if a developer explicitly (redundantly) checks for the pre-existing value they will get the desired serialization failure where the problem is caused by a concurrent serializable transaction; otherwise they will get a duplicate key error. While it would be better if the reads performed by the constraints could count as part of the work of the transaction for serialization failure checking, and we will hopefully get there some day, this patch allows a clean and reliable way for developers to work around the issue. In many cases existing code will already be doing the right thing for this to "just work".

<li>Modify BufferGetPage() to prepare for "snapshot too old" feature. This patch is a no-op patch which is intended to reduce the chances of failures of omission once the functional part of the "snapshot too old" patch goes in. It adds parameters for snapshot, relation, and an enum to specify whether the snapshot age check needs to be done for the page at this point. This initial patch passes NULL for the first two new parameters and BGP_NO_SNAPSHOT_TEST for the third. The follow-on patch will change the places where the test needs to be made. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/8b65cf4c5edabdcae45ceaef7b9ac236879aae50">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/8b65cf4c5edabdcae45ceaef7b9ac236879aae50</a></li>

<li>Add the "snapshot too old" feature. This feature is controlled by a new old_snapshot_threshold GUC. A value of -1 disables the feature, and that is the default. The value of 0 is just intended for testing. Above that it is the number of minutes a snapshot can reach before pruning and vacuum are allowed to remove dead tuples which the snapshot would otherwise protect. The xmin associated with a transaction ID does still protect dead tuples. A connection which is using an "old" snapshot does not get an error unless it accesses a page modified recently enough that it might not be able to produce accurate results. This is similar to the Oracle feature, and we use the same SQLSTATE and error message for compatibility. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/848ef42bb8c7909c9d7baa38178d4a209906e7c1">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/848ef42bb8c7909c9d7baa38178d4a209906e7c1</a></li>

<li>Increase maximum number of clog buffers. Benchmarking has shown that the current number of clog buffers limits scalability. We've previously increased the number in 33aaa139, but that's not sufficient with a large number of clients. We've benchmarked the cost of increasing the limit by benchmarking worst case scenarios; testing showed that 128 buffers don't cause a regression, even in contrived scenarios, whereas 256 does There are a number of more complex patches flying around to address various clog scalability problems, but this is simple enough that we can get it into 9.6; and is beneficial even after those patches have been applied. It is a bit unsatisfactory to increase this in small steps every few releases, but a better solution seems to require a rewrite of slru.c; not something done quickly.

<li>Expose more out/readfuncs support functions. Previously bcac23d exposed a subset of support functions, namely the ones Kaigai found useful. In 20160304193704.elq773pyg5fyl3mi@alap3.anarazel.de I mentioned that there's some functions missing to use the facility in an external project. To avoid having to add functions piecemeal, add all the functions which are used to define READ_* and WRITE_* macros; users of the extensible node functionality are likely to need these. Additionally expose outDatum(), which doesn't have it's own WRITE_ macro, as it needs information from the embedding struct.

<li>Avoid the use of a separate spinlock to protect a LWLock's wait queue. Previously we used a spinlock, in adition to the atomically manipulated -&gt;state field, to protect the wait queue. But it's pretty simple to instead perform the locking using a flag in state. Due to 6150a1b0 BufferDescs, on platforms (like PPC) with &gt; 1 byte spinlocks, increased their size above 64byte. As 64 bytes are the size we pad allocated BufferDescs to, this can increase false sharing; causing performance problems in turn. Together with the previous commit this reduces the size to &lt;= 64 bytes on all common platforms.

<li>Allow Pin/UnpinBuffer to operate in a lockfree manner. Pinning/Unpinning a buffer is a very frequent operation; especially in read-mostly cache resident workloads. Benchmarking shows that in various scenarios the spinlock protecting a buffer header's state becomes a significant bottleneck. The problem can be reproduced with pgbench -S on larger machines, but can be considerably worse for queries which touch the same buffers over and over at a high frequency (e.g. nested loops over a small inner table). To allow atomic operations to be used, cram BufferDesc's flags, usage_count, buf_hdr_lock, refcount into a single 32bit atomic variable; that allows to manipulate them together using 32bit compare-and-swap operations. This requires reducing MAX_BACKENDS to 2^18-1 (which could be lifted by using a 64bit field, but it's not a realistic configuration atm). As not all operations can easily implemented in a lockfree manner, implement the previous buf_hdr_lock via a flag bit in the atomic variable. That way we can continue to lock the header in places where it's needed, but can get away without acquiring it in the more frequent hot-paths. There's some additional operations which can be done without the lock, but aren't in this patch; but the most important places are covered. As bufmgr.c now essentially re-implements spinlocks, abstract the delay logic from s_lock.c into something more generic. It now has already two users, and more are coming up; there's a follupw patch for lwlock.c at least. This patch is based on a proof-of-concept written by me, which Alexander Korotkov made into a fully working patch; the committed version is again revised by me. Benchmarking and testing has, amongst others, been provided by Dilip Kumar, Alexander Korotkov, Robert Haas. On a large x86 system improvements for readonly pgbench, with a high client count, of a factor of 8 have been observed.
