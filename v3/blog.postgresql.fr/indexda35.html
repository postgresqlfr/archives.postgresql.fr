<p>Andrew Dunstan pushed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow TAP tests to run under Msys. The Msys DTK perl, which is required to run TAP tests under Msys as a native perl won't recognize the correct virtual paths, has its osname recorded in the Config module as 'msys' instead of 'MSWin32'. To avoid having to repeat the test a variable is created that is true iff the osname is either of these values, and is then used everywhere that matters. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/690ed2b76ab91eb79ea04ee2bfbdc8a2693f2a37">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/690ed2b76ab91eb79ea04ee2bfbdc8a2693f2a37</a></li>
<li>Remove carriage returns from certain tap test output under Msys. These were causing spurious test failures. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/ff85fc8d0b3ae88221e20ee9b070c23248eb7921">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/ff85fc8d0b3ae88221e20ee9b070c23248eb7921</a></li>
<li>Allow pg_rewind tap tests to run with older File::Path versions. Older versions have rmtree but not remove_tree. The one-argument forms of these are equivalent, so replace remove_tree with rmtree. This allows the tests to be run on oldish Msys systems. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/7c29764a354a0e7deb3c28e1d5c38ff6662ee3f9">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/7c29764a354a0e7deb3c28e1d5c38ff6662ee3f9</a></li>

<li>Fix a number of places that produced XX000 errors in the regression tests. It's against project policy to use elog() for user-facing errors, or to omit an errcode() selection for errors that aren't supposed to be "can't happen" cases. Fix all the violations of this policy that result in ERRCODE_INTERNAL_ERROR log entries during the standard regression tests, as errors that can reliably be triggered from SQL surely should be considered user-facing. I also looked through all the files touched by this commit and fixed other nearby problems of the same ilk. I do not claim to have fixed all violations of the policy, just the ones in these files. In a few places I also changed existing ERRCODE choices that didn't seem particularly appropriate; mainly replacing ERRCODE_SYNTAX_ERROR by something more specific. Back-patch to 9.5, but no further; changing ERRCODE assignments in stable branches doesn't seem like a good idea. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/09cecdf285ea9f51aed669f9ea1ba840197d49d0">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/09cecdf285ea9f51aed669f9ea1ba840197d49d0</a></li>
<li>contrib/isn now needs a .gitignore file. Oversight in commit cb3384a0cb4cf900622b77865f60e31259923079. Back-patch to 9.1, like that commit. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/fd7ed26c1a2353923be067dd84059f3ce3a5aff4">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/fd7ed26c1a2353923be067dd84059f3ce3a5aff4</a></li>
<li>Make modules/test_ddl_deparse/.gitignore match its siblings. Not sure why /tmp_check/ was omitted from this one, but even if it isn't really needed right now, it's inconsistent not to include it. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/e2b49db0f0c55196ae336e28bc142dddd38cad1e">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/e2b49db0f0c55196ae336e28bc142dddd38cad1e</a></li>
<li>Update 9.5 release notes through today. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/ecc2d16bc97d160d3b4beecfc46676bbaaf157a5">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/ecc2d16bc97d160d3b4beecfc46676bbaaf157a5</a></li>
<li>Fix a PlaceHolderVar-related oversight in star-schema planning patch. In commit b514a7460d9127ddda6598307272c701cbb133b7, I changed the planner so that it would allow nestloop paths to remain partially parameterized, ie the inner relation might need parameters from both the current outer relation and some upper-level outer relation. That's fine so long as we're talking about distinct parameters; but the patch also allowed creation of nestloop paths for cases where the inner relation's parameter was a PlaceHolderVar whose eval_at set included the current outer relation and some upper-level one. That does *not* work. In principle we could allow such a PlaceHolderVar to be evaluated at the lower join node using values passed down from the upper relation along with values from the join's own outer relation. However, nodeNestloop.c only supports simple Vars not arbitrary expressions as nestloop parameters. createplan.c is also a few bricks shy of being able to handle such cases; it misplaces the PlaceHolderVar parameters in the plan tree, which is why the visible symptoms of this bug are "plan should not reference subplan's variable" and "failed to assign all NestLoopParams to plan nodes" planner errors. Adding the necessary complexity to make this work doesn't seem like it would be repaid in significantly better plans, because in cases where such a PHV exists, there is probably a corresponding join order constraint that would allow a good plan to be found without using the star-schema exception. Furthermore, adding complexity to nodeNestloop.c would create a run-time penalty even for plans where this whole consideration is irrelevant. So let's just reject such paths instead. Per fuzz testing by Andreas Seltenreich; the added regression test is based on his example query. Back-patch to 9.2, like the previous patch. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/85e5e222b1dd02f135a8c3bf387d0d6d88e669bd">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/85e5e222b1dd02f135a8c3bf387d0d6d88e669bd</a></li>
<li>Fix bogus "out of memory" reports in tuplestore.c. The tuplesort/tuplestore memory management logic assumed that the chunk allocation overhead for its memtuples array could not increase when increasing the array size. This is and always was true for tuplesort, but we (I, I think) blindly copied that logic into tuplestore.c without noticing that the assumption failed to hold for the much smaller array elements used by tuplestore. Given rather small work_mem, this could result in an improper complaint about "unexpected out-of-memory situation", as reported by Brent DeSpain in bug #13530. The easiest way to fix this is just to increase tuplestore's initial array size so that the assumption holds. Rather than relying on magic constants, though, let's export a #define from aset.c that represents the safe allocation threshold, and make tuplestore's calculation depend on that. Do the same in tuplesort.c to keep the logic looking parallel, even though tuplesort.c isn't actually at risk at present. This will keep us from breaking it if we ever muck with the allocation parameters in aset.c. Back-patch to all supported versions. The error message doesn't occur pre-9.3, not so much because the problem can't happen as because the pre-9.3 tuplestore code neglected to check for it. (The chance of trouble is a great deal larger as of 9.3, though, due to changes in the array-size-increasing strategy.) However, allowing LACKMEM() to become true unexpectedly could still result in less-than-desirable behavior, so let's patch it all the way back. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/8ea3e7a75c0d22c41c57f59c8b367059b97d0b66">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/8ea3e7a75c0d22c41c57f59c8b367059b97d0b66</a></li>
<li>Fix pg_dump to dump shell types. Per discussion, it really ought to do this. The original choice to exclude shell types was probably made in the dark ages before we made it harder to accidentally create shell types; but that was in 7.3. Also, cause the standard regression tests to leave a shell type behind, for convenience in testing the case in pg_dump and pg_upgrade. Back-patch to all supported branches. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/3bdd7f90fc0a038ee8b5b3fd9f9507cf2f07a4b2">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/3bdd7f90fc0a038ee8b5b3fd9f9507cf2f07a4b2</a></li>
<li>Docs: add an explicit example about controlling overall greediness of REs. Per discussion of bug #13538. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/1b5d34ca6244a9296215325a9f82fb805e739f9e">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/1b5d34ca6244a9296215325a9f82fb805e739f9e</a></li>
<li>Make real sure we don't reassociate joins into or out of SEMI/ANTI joins. Per the discussion in optimizer/README, it's unsafe to reassociate anything into or out of the RHS of a SEMI or ANTI join. An example from Piotr Stefaniak showed that join_is_legal() wasn't sufficiently enforcing this rule, so lock it down a little harder. I couldn't find a reasonably simple example of the optimizer trying to do this, so no new regression test. (Piotr's example involved the random search in GEQO accidentally trying an invalid case and triggering a sanity check way downstream in clause selectivity estimation, which did not seem like a sequence of events that would be useful to memorialize in a regression test as-is.) Back-patch to all active branches. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/6af9ee4c8c8f31cbf2e76166d1d9868876f60aea">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/6af9ee4c8c8f31cbf2e76166d1d9868876f60aea</a></li>
<li>Further fixes for degenerate outer join clauses. Further testing revealed that commit f69b4b9495269cc4 was still a few bricks shy of a load: minor tweaking of the previous test cases resulted in the same wrong-outer-join-order problem coming back. After study I concluded that my previous changes in make_outerjoininfo() were just accidentally masking the problem, and should be reverted in favor of forcing syntactic join order whenever an upper outer join's predicate doesn't mention a lower outer join's LHS. This still allows the chained-outer-joins style that is the normally optimizable case. I also tightened things up some more in join_is_legal(). It seems to me on review that what's really happening in the exception case where we ignore a mismatched special join is that we're allowing the proposed join to associate into the RHS of the outer join we're comparing it to. As such, we should *always* insist that the proposed join be a left join, which eliminates a bunch of rather dubious argumentation. The case where we weren't enforcing that was the one that was already known buggy anyway (it had a violatable Assert before the aforesaid commit) so it hardly deserves a lot of deference. Back-patch to all active branches, like the previous patch. The added regression test case failed in all branches back to 9.1, and I think it's only an unrelated change in costing calculations that kept 9.0 from choosing a broken plan. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/8703059c6b55c427100e00a09f66534b6ccbfaa1">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/8703059c6b55c427100e00a09f66534b6ccbfaa1</a></li>
<li>Fix eclass_useful_for_merging to give valid results for appendrel children. Formerly, this function would always return "true" for an appendrel child relation, because it would think that the appendrel parent was a potential join target for the child. In principle that should only lead to some inefficiency in planning, but fuzz testing by Andreas Seltenreich disclosed that it could lead to "could not find pathkey item to sort" planner errors in odd corner cases. Specifically, we would think that all columns of a child table's multicolumn index were interesting pathkeys, causing us to generate a MergeAppend path that sorts by all the columns. However, if any of those columns weren't actually used above the level of the appendrel, they would not get added to that rel's targetlist, which would result in being unable to resolve the MergeAppend's sort keys against its targetlist during createplan.c. Backpatch to 9.3. In older versions, columns of an appendrel get added to its targetlist even if they're not mentioned above the scan level, so that the failure doesn't occur. It might be worth back-patching this fix to older versions anyway, but I'll refrain for the moment. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/cde35cf4ae968d3366ea5358d2a754641e4c06c8">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/cde35cf4ae968d3366ea5358d2a754641e4c06c8</a></li>
<li>Fix old oversight in join removal logic. Commit 9e7e29c75ad441450f9b8287bd51c13521641e3b introduced an Assert that join removal didn't reduce the eval_at set of any PlaceHolderVar to empty. At first glance it looks like join_is_removable ensures that's true --- but actually, the loop in join_is_removable skips PlaceHolderVars that are not referenced above the join due to be removed. So, if we don't want any empty eval_at sets, the right thing to do is to delete any now-unreferenced PlaceHolderVars from the data structure entirely. Per fuzz testing by Andreas Seltenreich. Back-patch to 9.3 where the aforesaid Assert was added. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/bab163e1218c0c36ccb0c0ef1b8f2d6feb2fc122">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/bab163e1218c0c36ccb0c0ef1b8f2d6feb2fc122</a></li>
<li>Further adjustments to PlaceHolderVar removal. A new test case from Andreas Seltenreich showed that we were still a bit confused about removing PlaceHolderVars during join removal. Specifically, remove_rel_from_query would remove a PHV that was used only underneath the removable join, even if the place where it's used was the join partner relation and not the join clause being deleted. This would lead to a "too late to create a new PlaceHolderInfo" error later on. We can defend against that by checking ph_eval_at to see if the PHV could possibly be getting used at some partner rel. Also improve some nearby LATERAL-related logic. I decided that the check on ph_lateral needed to take precedence over the check on ph_needed, in case there's a lateral reference underneath the join being considered. (That may be impossible, but I'm not convinced of it, and it's easy enough to defend against the case.) Also, I realized that remove_rel_from_query's logic for updating LateralJoinInfos is dead code, because we don't build those at all until after join removal. Back-patch to 9.3. Previous versions didn't have the LATERAL issues, of course, and they also didn't attempt to remove PlaceHolderInfos during join removal. (I'm starting to wonder if changing that was really such a great idea.) <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/89db83922a7f8ba223e233e262004b1745ece75d">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/89db83922a7f8ba223e233e262004b1745ece75d</a></li>
<li>Remove gram.y's precedence declaration for OVERLAPS. The allowed syntax for OVERLAPS, viz "row OVERLAPS row", is sufficiently constrained that we don't actually need a precedence declaration for OVERLAPS; indeed removing this declaration does not change the generated gram.c file at all. Let's remove it to avoid confusion about whether OVERLAPS has precedence or not. If we ever generalize what we allow for OVERLAPS, we might need to put back a precedence declaration for it, but we might want some other level than what it has today --- and leaving the declaration there would just risk confusion about whether that would be an incompatible change. Likewise, remove OVERLAPS from the documentation's precedence table. Per discussion with Noah Misch. Back-patch to 9.5 where we hacked up some nearby precedence decisions. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/1e3e1ae266502eb6a15a788f74d48b7c94196f56">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/1e3e1ae266502eb6a15a788f74d48b7c94196f56</a></li>

<li>Share transition state between different aggregates when possible. If there are two different aggregates in the query with same inputs, and the aggregates have the same initial condition and transition function, only calculate the state value once, and only call the final functions separately. For example, AVG(x) and SUM(x) aggregates have the same transition function, which accumulates the sum and number of input tuples. For a query like "SELECT AVG(x), SUM(x) FROM x", we can therefore accumulate the state function only once, which gives a nice speedup.

There is no harm in retaining it, but it is better to get rid of the map file so that we don't have any redundant file in data directory and it will avoid any sort of confusion.

<li>Reduce ProcArrayLock contention by removing backends in batches. When a write transaction commits, it must clear its XID advertised via the ProcArray, which requires that we hold ProcArrayLock in exclusive mode in order to prevent concurrent processes running GetSnapshotData from seeing inconsistent results. When many processes try to commit at once, ProcArrayLock must change hands repeatedly, with each concurrent process trying to commit waking up to acquire the lock in turn. To make things more efficient, when more than one backend is trying to commit a write transaction at the same time, have just one of them acquire ProcArrayLock in exclusive mode and clear the XIDs of all processes in the group. Benchmarking reveals that this is much more efficient at very high client counts.

<li>Rely on inline functions even if that causes warnings in older compilers. So far we have worked around the fact that some very old compilers do not support 'inline' functions by only using inline functions conditionally (or not at all). Since such compilers are very rare by now, we have decided to rely on inline functions from 9.6 onwards. To avoid breaking these old compilers inline is defined away when not supported. That'll cause "function x defined but not used" type of warnings, but since nobody develops on such compilers anymore that's ok. This change in policy will allow us to more easily employ inline functions. I chose to remove code previously conditional on PG_USE_INLINE as it seemed confusing to have code dependent on a define that's always defined. Blacklisting of compilers, like in c53f73879f, now has to be done differently. A platform template can define PG_FORCE_DISABLE_INLINE to force inline to be defined empty.

<li>Don't include low level locking code from frontend code. Some frontend code like e.g. pg_xlogdump or pg_resetxlog, has to use backend headers. Unfortunately until now that code includes most of the locking code. It's generally not nice to expose such low level details, but de6fd1c898 made that a hard problem. We fall back to defining 'inline' away if the compiler doesn't support it - that can cause linker errors like on buildfarm animal pademelon if a inline function references backend only code. To fix that problem separate definitions from lock.h that are required from frontend code into lockdefs.h and use it in the relevant places. I've only removed the minimal amount of necessary definitions for now - it might turn out that we want more for other reasons. To avoid such details being exposed again put some checks against being included from frontend code into atomics.h, lock.h, lwlock.h and s_lock.h. It's otherwise fairly easy to indirectly include these headers.

<li>Attempt to work around a 32bit xlc compiler bug from a different place. In de6fd1c8 I moved the the work around from 53f73879 into the aix template. The previous location was removed in the former commit, and I thought that it would be nice to emit a warning when running configure. That didn't turn out to work because at the point the template is included we don't know whether we're compiling a 32/64 bit binary and it's possible to install compilers for both on a 64 bit kernel/OS. So go back to a less ambitious approach and define PG_FORCE_DISABLE_INLINE in port/aix.h, without emitting a warning. We could try a more fancy approach, but it doesn't seem worth it. This requires moving the check for PG_FORCE_DISABLE_INLINE in c.h to after including the system headers included from therein which isn't perfect, as it seems slightly more robust to include all system headers in a similar environment. Oh well.

When default_transaction_isolation = 'serializable' these acquire relation-level SIReadLocks. The test results didn't cope with that. Add SIReadLock as the minimum lock level for purposes of these tests. This could also be fixed by excluding this type of lock from the my_locks view, but it would be a bug for SIReadLock to show up for a relation which was not otherwise locked, so do it this way to allow that sort of condition to cause a regression test failure. There is some question whether we could avoid taking SIReadLocks during these operations, but confirming the safety of that and figuring out how to avoid the locks is not trivial, and would be a separate patch. Backpatch to 9.4 where the new tests were added. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/253de7e1eb9abbcf57e6c229a8a38abd6455c7de">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/253de7e1eb9abbcf57e6c229a8a38abd6455c7de</a></li>

<li>Fix BRIN to use SnapshotAny during summarization. For correctness of summarization results, it is critical that the snapshot used during the summarization scan is able to see all tuples that are live to all transactions -- including tuples inserted or deleted by in-progress transactions. Otherwise, it would be possible for a transaction to insert a tuple, then idle for a long time while a concurrent transaction executes summarization of the range: this would result in the inserted value not being considered in the summary. Previously we were trying to use a MVCC snapshot in conjunction with adding a "placeholder" tuple in the index: the snapshot would see all committed tuples, and the placeholder tuple would catch insertions by any new inserters. The hole is that prior insertions by transactions that are still in progress by the time the MVCC snapshot was taken were ignored. Kevin Grittner reported this as a bogus error message during vacuum with default transaction isolation mode set to repeatable read (because the error report mentioned a function name not being invoked during), but the problem is larger than that. To fix, tweak IndexBuildHeapRangeScan to have a new mode that behaves the way we need using SnapshotAny visibility rules. This change simplifies the BRIN code a bit, mainly by removing large comments that were mistaken. Instead, rely on the SnapshotAny semantics to provide what it needs. (The business about a placeholder tuple needs to remain: that covers the case that a transaction inserts a a tuple in a page that summarization already scanned.)

<li>Fix broken multibyte regression tests. commit 9043Fe390f4f0b4586cfe59cbd22314b9c3e2957 broke multibyte regression tests because the commit removes the warning message when temporary hash indexes is created, which has been added by commit 07af523870bcfe930134054febd3a6a114942e5b. Back patched to 9.5 stable tree. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/efc1610b64b04e7cf08cc1d6c608ede8b7d5ff07">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/efc1610b64b04e7cf08cc1d6c608ede8b7d5ff07</a></li>
