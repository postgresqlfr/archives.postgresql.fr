 Hi,

(1) The SYWARE_SyncInfo table has a column called DesktopOID iand a column called HandheldOID, but it does should not have a column called OID.

(2) In the log you sent, the driver coninues to have the same problem you reported before: we asked the driver if the table SYWARE_SyncInfo exists or not, the driver says NO, and then compains that the file exists when we try to create it.  YOU WILL HAVE TO TALK TO THE POSTGRESS PEOPLE TO RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM.  This is a problem with the POSTGRESS ODBC driver.  We have no control over this driver.

Craig
